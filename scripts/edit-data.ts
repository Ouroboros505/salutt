/**
 * Editing the log from the desktop, safely.
 *
 * Salutt merges row by row and orders by when a row last changed, so a write
 * made here has to say when it was made. A row pushed without a fresh stamp
 * ties with the copy already on the phone and loses silently — which is
 * exactly how the first pass at correcting a recipe vanished. `touch()` is
 * therefore not optional politeness: it is what makes the edit take.
 *
 * Everything not touched is left alone, and the phone keeps anything it has
 * edited more recently, so this can never overwrite a day of logging.
 *
 *   npm run edit -- --dry     print what would change
 *   npm run edit              apply it
 *
 * The edit itself lives in `change()` below — rewrite it per task.
